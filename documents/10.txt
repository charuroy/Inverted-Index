The interview was published as official photographs 
for the christening of Prince George were released
They showed the Queen with three future kings the 
Prince of Wales the Duke of Cambridge and Prince 
George
It was the first such image since the christening 
of the future Edward VIII with his father George V
grandfather Edward VII and great grandmother Queen 
Victoria
I sure some of the Royal family are very decent 
people really know but should an accident of birth
be a qualification for vast wealth and enormous 
privilege I though this was the Century Charles is 
damaged goods and his accession to the throne has 
trouble written all over it
